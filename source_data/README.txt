source_data/README.txt

Place any source data files into this directory to allow access to them in the
/data/source_data directory within the rocker-grass container used for the analysis. 

Future development - add a script to the repository to copy the collection of 
reference source datasets into this directory for reproducibility within the
analysis container.
