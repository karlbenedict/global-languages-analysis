This repository contains the file structure, analytic code, and scripts for
building the needed Docker container, retrieving required source data, and
executing the analyses associated with the Global Linguistics project. 

The core analytic container can be generated by running the `build.sh` shell 
script in an environment that already has Docker installed and running. 

The analytic container that is produced by the `build.sh` script can then be
started for analytic use by running the `start.sh` shell script. The default
username when logging into the web-based RStudio environment is `rstudio` 
and the default password, which can/should be changed in the `start.sh` script,
is provided in the `start.sh` script. 

The analytic scripts and supporting files are found in the `scripts` directory
in the RStudio environment and named output files are placed either in the 
`temp` directory or `output` directories depending on the desired persistance
of the output products. 

It is recommended that the scripts be run in their numeric sequence (i.e. 01_01... 
before 01_02..., etc.) to ensure that required dependencies are met. Running all
of the source data processing scripts (i.e. the scripts starting with '01_') will
take several hours, with the actual time needed depending upon the speed of
the internet connection and processor speed.
